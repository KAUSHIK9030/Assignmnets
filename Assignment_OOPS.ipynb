        "##1. What are the five key concepts of Object-oOriented Programming(OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or object.\n",
        "It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components to protect the integrity of the data. This is typically done by making certain properties private or protected, and providing public methods (getters/setters) to access or modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**example**\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "  def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "       \n",
        "self._brand = brand   # protected attribute\n",
        "        \n",
        " self.__model = model  # private attribute\n",
        "    \n",
        " def get_model(self):\n",
        "  \n",
        "  return self.__model   # public method to access private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex details and only exposing the essential features of an object. It allows you to work with objects at a high level, without needing to understand the intricate details of how they work.\n",
        "In Python, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes or interfaces, where certain methods are declared but not implemented, leaving the subclasses to provide specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**example**\n",
        "\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Shape(ABC):\n",
        "\n",
        " @abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        " def area(self):\n",
        "\n",
        "   pass  # Abstract method, to be implemented by subclasses\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called a subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a superclass or parent class). It promotes code reusability and extensibility by allowing subclasses to use or modify behaviors defined in parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**example**\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "\n",
        " def speak(self):\n",
        "\n",
        " return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal\n",
        "\n",
        "def speak(self):\n",
        "\n",
        "return \"Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows a single method or function to operate differently depending on the type of object it is called upon, facilitating flexibility and integration.\n",
        "Polymorphism is often achieved using method overriding and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "**example**\n",
        "\n",
        "class Bird:\n",
        "\n",
        " def speak(self):\n",
        "  \n",
        "   return \"Chirp\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat:\n",
        "   \n",
        " def speak(self):\n",
        "    \n",
        " return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Polymorphism\n",
        "def animal_speak(animal):\n",
        "\n",
        "print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "bird = Bird()\n",
        "\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "animal_speak(bird)  # Output: Chirp\n",
        "\n",
        "animal_speak(cat)   # Output: Meow\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Object/Class**\n",
        "\n",
        " The core concepts in OOP are classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes and methods that its objects will have. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity that contains the data and behavior defined by the class.\n",
